  abstract = {We have studied in detail the Zeeman-tuned slowing of a beam of sodium
	atoms. We present experimental data that examine details of the slowing
	by studying the atomic beam both as it slows and after the slowing
	process has been completed. A Monte Carlo computer simulation reproduces
	many of the details of our experimental data. We also discuss an
	analytic model based on the idea that the slowing proceeds adiabatically---that
	is, such that slowing atoms are always nearly resonant with the laser.
	This model allows us to give simple physical interpretations to many
	of the features of our data.},

  abstract = {We describe a simple slow atom source for loading a rubidium magneto-optical
	trap. The source includes an effusive oven with a long heated collimation
	tube. Almost all components are standard vacuum parts. The heating
	elements and thermocouples are external to the vacuum, protecting
	them from the hostile hot alkali environment and allowing repair
	without breaking vacuum. The thermal source is followed by a Zeeman
	slower with a single-layer coil of variable winding pitch. The single-layer
	design is simple to construct and has low inductance which allows
	for rapid switching of the magnetic field. The coil pitch was determined
	by fitting the analytic form of the magnetic field for a variable
	winding pitch to the desired magnetic field profile required to slow
	atoms. The measured magnetic field for the constructed coil is in
	excellent agreement with the desired field. The source produces atoms
	at 35 m/s with a flux up to 2×1010 cm−2 s−1 at 200 °C.},
