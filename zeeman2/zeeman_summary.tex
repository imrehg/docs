\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document to summarize our simulation and construction results of the Zeeman slower in our lab.

\section{Theory}

\subsection{Field shape}

\begin{equation}
a(z) = -\frac{\hbar k \Gamma}{2 m} \frac{s}{1 + s + 4 \delta(z)^2 / \Gamma^2}
\label{eq:accel}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is $I/I_{\rm sat}$ saturation parameter. The assumed maximum deceleration is at $s \rightarrow \infty$, and at $\delta = 0$ we have $\eta = \frac{s}{1 + s}$.

The detuning is 
\begin{equation}
\delta(z) = k v(z) + \Delta - \frac{\mu'}{\hbar} B(z)
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
\mu' = \mu_{B}(g_e m_e - g_g m_g)
\end{equation}
and in our case $\mu' = \mu_{B}$.

Most people use the ``ideal'' field profile, assuming constant deceleration (e.g adapted from \cite{Bell2010}):
\begin{equation}
B_{\rm ideal}(z) = \frac{\hbar k}{\mu'}\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 \eta a_m z} + B_a
\label{eq:bideal}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the cooling efficiency, $v_0$ is the maximum capture velocity chosen (or fixed by a given slower length and $\eta$), $a_m = -\frac{\hbar k \Gamma}{2 m}$ is the maximum deceleration, from Eq. \ref{eq:accel} setting $s = \infty$, and $B_a$ is a bias field, or an equivalent laser detuning from the resonance as $B_a = \frac{\hbar}{\mu'} \Delta$.

In this case the magnetic field gradient is
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial B_{\rm ideal}}{\partial z} = \frac{\hbar k}{\mu'} \frac{\eta a_m}{\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2 \eta a z}}
\end{equation}
which is a negative number because $a_m < 0$.

From Eq. \ref{eq:accel} and \ref{eq:bideal} one can deduce that the efficiency is
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{s}{1 + s}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Detuning}

The detuning at a given position is given by three contribution as
\begin{equation}
\delta = k v + \Delta - \frac{\mu'}{\hbar} B
\end{equation}
where v is the atomic velocity.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial z} = k \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} - \frac{\mu'}{\hbar}\frac{\partial B}{\partial z} = k \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} \frac{1} {\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}} - \frac{\mu'}{\hbar}\frac{\partial B}{\partial z}
= k \frac {a}{v} - \frac{\mu'}{\hbar}\frac{\partial B}{\partial z}
\label{eq:dddz}
\end{equation}

Without change in the magnetic field (that is zero gradient), there's always just going to lower detuning. On the other hand, when there's $\partial B/\partial z < 0$: the can be stable and unstable points: either 1 stable and 2 unstable, or 1 unstable if $|\partial B / \partial z| >> 0$ (set a more correct level for this).


Figure \ref{fig:dddz1} shows the spatial gradient of the detuning $\partial \delta / \partial z$ for a set of commonly used parameters and assuming a constant magnetic field. The gradient is negative in the entire region, meaning that the detuning is moving to the red. Given the parameters, that means $\partial v / \partial z < 0$, which is deceleration. Given the profile, the deceleration is the largest near the resonance, and away from it is decreasing rapidly.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{detu1}
\caption{The spatial gradient of detuning $\delta$ with $\partial B/\partial z=0$ at $z=0$, $v_0 = 254~m/s$, $\eta = 0.5$ and $s = 1$. The arrow means that over the whole whole plotted range, the detuning is decreasing (going red).}
\label{fig:dddz1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:dddz2} is a similar plot using the same parameters except for the magnetic field, where $B_{\rm ideal}$ is used as defined in Eq. \ref{eq:bideal}, with its field gradient. Now $\partial \delta / \partial z \geq 0$, meaning the detuning is moving to the blue (because of the change in $B$). There's one special point (for the given parameters) near $\delta = 0$ where $\partial \delta / \partial z = 0$, that is the detuning will be constant. Since $B$ is changing, this implies change in $v$ as well, and given the signs of the changes, implies deceleration.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{detu2}
\caption{As Fig. \ref{fig:dddz1} but with $B=B_{\rm ideal}$. The arrow means that over the whole range the detuning is increasing (going blue). Exception is near $\delta = 0$ where there is a fixed point.}
\label{fig:dddz2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{detu3}
\caption{As Fig. \ref{fig:dddz2} but with $s = 2$, which means higher laser intensity. The line is widened and its height has increased. Now there is a true stable fixed point near $\delta = -0.5 \Gamma$ and an unstable fix point near $\delta = 0.5 \Gamma$. Further increase of laser intensity will push the fixed points away from $\delta = 0$.}
\label{fig:dddz3}
\end{figure}

The zero crossing can be calculated analytically by reorganizing Equation \ref{eq:dddz}. We can make the following substitutions for notational convenience:
\begin{eqnarray}
v &=& \frac{1}{k}\left(\delta - \Delta + \frac{\mu'}{\hbar}B\right) \\
A &=& \frac{\mu'}{\hbar}B \\
X &=& A - \Delta \\
Y &=& 1+s \\
Z &=& \frac{4}{\Gamma^2} \\
W &=& - \frac{\hbar k^3 \Gamma s}{2 m}.
\end{eqnarray}
The detuning $\delta$ can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\delta^3 + X \delta^2 + \frac{Y}{z} \delta + \frac{A X Y - W}{A Z}= 0
\end{equation}
which is just a standard cubic equation. The displayed 2 roots (out of the 3) of Figure \ref{fig:dddz3} are calculated with this method.

\subsection{Controlling the final velocity}

The final velocity depends on multiple parameters. We can choose a velocity that we can design for, effectively making a shorter slower on the ``slow side''. In practice the current in the negative coil can be adjusted to directly affect the final velocity. Other groups usually reduce the current in the negative coil. Some relevat simulations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:trajectory1}, \ref{fig:trajectory2} and \ref{fig:trajectory3} in Section \ref{seq:sim}  The Doppler cooling beam's saturation parameter also affects the final velocity, as higher saturation will give rise to larger red detuning $\delta \ll 0$, and thus lower final velocity.


\section{Construction}

\subsection{Simulation}
\label{seq:sim}

Here are the simulation results, and our choice for the used design. 
Finally a $0.59 m$ slower length was chosen, with AWG12 teflon coated wire, and maxium layer number of 10. The simulated layer positions are listed in Table \ref{tab:layers}, while the field is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:simcoil}.

\end{figure}

There's also simulation results for the the effect of reduced current in the negative coil. That seems to be the standard method for adjusting the flux, though the reduction is not as severe as we simulated. The reduction seems to be more in the 0.9-0.8 region compared to the designed current, when it is the same value on both coils: $I_{pos} = I_{neg}$. Figure \ref{fig:trajectory1} shows the simulated atom trajectories (the velocity as a function of position along the slower) for the designed current, while Figure \ref{fig:trajectory2} shows $I_{pos} = 0.5 \times I_{neg}$ and Figure \ref{fig:trajectory3} the extreme $I_{pos} = 0.25 \times I_{neg}$.

\subsection{Assembly}

Figure \ref{fig:slowerfield} shows the measured magnetic field as a function of position along the Zeeman slower tube. For comparison the simulated field is also shown. The absolute size of the simulated field is given by the applied current, the horizontal position is by measuring the coil position, and thus no fitting has been performed. Also plotted the expected field based on the actual measured coil positions. The end of the zeeman slower tube is indicated by vertical lines. The field outside of the tube should be suitably low not to affect the rest of the experiment, though it is probably necessary to check the requirements regarding the B-field of the radial Doppler-cooling if we decide to implement that.
