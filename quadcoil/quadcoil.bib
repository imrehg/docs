  abstract = {In modern pulsed power systems, often, fast solid-state switches like
	MOSFETs and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules are
	used to generate short high power pulses. In order to increase the
	pulsed power, solid-state switches have to be connected in series
	or in parallel. Depending on the interconnection of the switches,
	parameter variations in the switches and in the system can lead to
	an unbalanced voltage or current. Therefore, the switches are generally
	derated, which results in an increased number of required devices,
	cost, and volume. With an active gate control, derating and preselection
	of the switching devices can be avoided. In this paper, an active
	gate control of paralleled IGBT modules, which has been developed
	for converters with inductive load, is explained in detail and adapted
	to a solid-state modulator. This paper focuses on achieving a low-inductance
	IGBT current measurement, the control unit implementation with a
	field-programmable gate array and a digital signal processor, as
	well as the balancing of the pulse currents.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents the study of atomic cloud density and temperature
	in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). The purpose is to find the method
	in obtaining the densest and coldest cloud the setup can produce.
	In steady state trap, the highest atomic density possible is that
	of a cloud in multiple scattering regime where a repulsive force
	between atoms sets a limit to the density. The number of atoms loaded
	into the trap is controlled by the trapping beam intensity which
	also changes the temperature. Therefore the trap density and temperature
	cannot be controlled separately. The cloud compression is studied
	as a method of increasing atomic density above what is possible in
	steady state trap without noticeable influence on the cloud temperature.
	Cloud compression is also found when the cloud is translated by changing
	the magnetic field zero-point although in a less predictable fashion
	than the compression.},

  title = {Quantum Reflection of Bose-Einstein Condensates},
  school = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Recent developments in atom optics have brought Bose-Einstein condensates
	within 1 μm of solid surfaces where the atom-surface interactions
	can no longer be ignored. At longrange, the atom-surface interaction
	is described by the weakly attractive Casimir-Polder potential which
	is classically predicted to accelerate an incident atom toward the
	surface where it will interact strongly with the internal modes of
	the surface, lose energy, and land in a bound state of the surface.
	When the incident atom is very cold, on the order of a few nanokelvin,
	however, the acceleration of the atomic wavefunction is so abrupt
	that the atom may partially reflect from the attractive tail in a
	process known as quantum reflection. This work presents experimental
	evidence for quantum reflection from a solid surface at normal incidence.
	Using atoms from a 23 Na BEC, cooled to a few nanokelvin in a recently
	demonstrated single-coil trap, controlled collisions were induced
	between atoms and solid silicon surface. A maximum reflection probability
	of ∼ 12% was observed for an incident velocity of 1 mm/s. Atoms confined
	against the surface at low density exhibited an enhanced lifetime
	due to quantum reflection. A surprising aspect of quantum reflection
	is that nano-structured surfaces are predicted to exhibit enhanced
	quantum reflection due to the reduction of the atom-surface interaction
	from reduced density surfaces. Using a pillared surface with an density
	reduced to 1% of bulk density, we observe an enhancement of the reflection
	probability to ∼ 60%. At velocities from 2-25 mm/s, predicted threshold
	dependence of the reflection probability was observed. At velocities
	below 2 mm/s, the reflection probability was observed to saturate.
	We develop a simple model which predicts the saturation as a result
	of mean-field interactions between atoms in the incident Bose-Einstein
	condensate.},

  abstract = {A cold atom experiment can be used to simulate analogous solid-state
	systems. This provides the bene?t of having a high degree of control

	Disordered transport is one example of where such a system has much
	to o?er. This thesis concerns the development of a Bose-Fermi mixture
	experiment for study of two-dimensional optical lattice systems.
	To achieve single site resolution of the lattice, the experiment
	makes use of a double microscope set-up. One microscope provides
	imaging and the second is used to image a spatial light modulator
	onto the atomic plane. This provides an extremely versatile potential
	landscape for a trapped cloud.
	
	This thesis presents an overview of the set-up of the experiment including
	progress towards condensation. Particular focus is given to the design
	and characterisation of the vacuum system and the combined double
	microscope and spatial light modulator system. The vacuum system
	design requires a narrow magneto-optical trapping chamber. A novel
	epoxy sealing technique has been developed, allowing construction
	of a chamber of just 36mm thickness whilst maintaining high optical
	access. To provide illumination for the spatial light modulator a
	technique for homogenising the output of multi-mode ?bre has been
