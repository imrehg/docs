  abstract = {In modern pulsed power systems, often, fast solid-state switches like
	MOSFETs and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules are
	used to generate short high power pulses. In order to increase the
	pulsed power, solid-state switches have to be connected in series
	or in parallel. Depending on the interconnection of the switches,
	parameter variations in the switches and in the system can lead to
	an unbalanced voltage or current. Therefore, the switches are generally
	derated, which results in an increased number of required devices,
	cost, and volume. With an active gate control, derating and preselection
	of the switching devices can be avoided. In this paper, an active
	gate control of paralleled IGBT modules, which has been developed
	for converters with inductive load, is explained in detail and adapted
	to a solid-state modulator. This paper focuses on achieving a low-inductance
	IGBT current measurement, the control unit implementation with a
	field-programmable gate array and a digital signal processor, as
	well as the balancing of the pulse currents.},
